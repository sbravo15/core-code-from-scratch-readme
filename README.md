### Explanation About Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
Computers don't speak English or Spanish, they speak **Machine Code**. Machine code is a computer programming language comprising binary instructinos which computers respond directly to, It's written in machine language. Therefore, a machine i.e., a computer, can execute it without any translation or conversion.

So then, How do computers read the code we write in a programming language? 
If we gave computers the text of the logic and instructions we want to execute with a set program, the computer would have no way to read it and execute it. 
## Introducing Interpreted and Compiled Programming Languages 
A programming language allows us to translate the abstract `1 & 0's / Binary` into something humans can understand. 


###Two types of languages 
1. High-Level
Java, Javascript, Python, C# and many more.

2. Low-Level
Languages that are closer to **Machine Code** therefore easier for the computer to read. 
Benefits Include: They're fast, precise control on how they want the computer to function.
Ex: Machine code, Assembly Language

### Compiled                                                
| Pros     | Cons |                                    
| ----------- | ----------- |                               
| **ready** to to run      | **not** cross platform       |     
| often **faster**  | inflexible        | inflexible  |    
| source code is **private**          | extra Step    |          

## Interpreted 
| Pros     | Cons |                                    
| ----------- | ----------- |                               
| cross-Platform     | interpreted required      |     
| simpler to test | inflexible        | often **slower** |    
| easier to debug         | source code is **public**   |
